## Positive aspects of submission:

Thank you for your submission. Your code is very well commented on and you have shown some understanding
of recursion in your reverseString() function.

## Aspects to improve:

Java block indentation is 2 spaces. You can have a look at your IDE settings to set the
tab key to input 2 spaces rather than 4. Also make sure when you name a function or 
variable that the name is not ambiguous or vague to prevent confusion when someone else
reads your code. Also remember Java uses UpperCamelCase for class names and lowerCamelCase
for funtion and variables names. Here is a link to the java style guide 
https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html section 4 will help you with formatting
and section 5 will help with naming.

At line 7-8 and 18-19 the line-wrapping is incorrect. You cannot add a line break in the middle
of a string as it will cause a compiling error.

The logic in your reverseString() function is good and should work you just made a small spelling
error at line 20 when you call your function recursively.

Your fibonacci function on line 21 does not take an integer as a parameter but a generic object. 
It also is not implemented recursively and needs a better name.A recursive function is one that calls 
itself untill a specific condition is met. Have a look at this link for more information about 
recursion https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_recursion.asp. At line 23 you gave a variable the 
same name as a parameter variable which will cause a compiling error.


## Overall feedback:

This is a very good attempt. Try implementing your fibonacci function recursively and have a read through 
the Java style guide. Keep up the good work.
