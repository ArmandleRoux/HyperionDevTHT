I would offer the student an explanation as to how I put my review together. I would 
ask the student to provide me with the parts of the review they felt were generic and 
unhelpful. I will then explain to the student why I gave the feedback I did, how it 
benefits them and how it relates to their sumbmission. I will remind the student that
my top priority is to help them succeed with their studies and my intention with my 
feedback is always to help them learn and grow. I would encourage the student to contact
me about any problems they may have with my reviews in the future so we can have a 
discussion about it in order to prevent them from feeling the need to go to social media 
to have their complaints resolved.
