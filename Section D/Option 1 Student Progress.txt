The 5 students that are behind. I will:
- contact them and tell them to book a mentor support call in order to get them back on track and 
  help them to succeed with their studies 
- ask them to try and identifiy what is causing them to lag behind and/or what topics they are 
  stuggling with so we can discuss it during the call 
- advice them to create a time schedule to catch up and to stick to that schedule to prevent them 
  from falling behind again 
- encourage them to join the discord channels and ask their fellow students for assistance for the 
  topics they are struggling with

The 10 students at risk of falling behind. I will:
- contact them to find out if there is anything they are having a hard time with or anything they do 
  not understand that I could help with 
- speak to them about keeping their time management in mind 
- advice them to stick to their time schedule to prevent them from falling behind their expected progress 
- encourage them to help others and ask questions in the discord channels as some of the other students 
  may have had the same or similar issues and may be able to assist them

The 5 students that are ahead of expected progress. I will:
- have them continue normally and will assist them as needed as they clearly have an understanding of 
  the topic at hand and will ask questions if they struggle 
- encourage them to help their fellow students that ask for help in the discord channels as this will 
  also be very beneficial to themselves and will improve their understanding of the topic aswell by 
  having to repeat what they have learned

Lastly I will remind all my student that they are welcome to contact me on discord for assistance and I 
will assist them as soon as I can.
